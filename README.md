# Multilayer Demo for Mexico City Geoportal

Multilayer is achieved through an angularjs-based selector (to keep HTML as clean and self-contained as possible) and a basemap-agnostic (i.e. it works with Leaflet, Google maps or whatever) logic.

Mexico City Demo URL:

http://multilayer.cartodb.io/multilayer.html?u=andrewbt&t=multilayer&v=9c5ed27c-ad4f-11e4-ae79-0e853d047bba&tt=Mexico%20DF%20Geoportal&d=A%20multilayer%20site%20for%20Finanzas%20DF

All datasets are contained in the "finanzasdf-admin" CartoDB account. The "multilayer" table that populates the selector is on the "andrewbt" account. In a production use case, these could be changed to be under one account.

URL params:

* u: username
* t: table with the layers
* v: viz.json UUID for the basemap (this visualization may contain data as well, but please remember this layer is *not* included in the selector and can't be hidden)
* tt: Title of the map
* d: Description - Keep it short!

Required row fields in the layer table:

* cartodb_id: not used
* the_geom: not_used
* name: name to appear in the selector
* show: true if layer is to be displayed initially
* viz_json: URL for the viz.json that corresponds to the visualization (takes precedence over sql and cartocss)
* sql: SQL query for the data in the layer (used if viz_json is not present)
* cartocss: CartoCSS for the layer (used if viz_json is not present)
* interactivity: Fields to interact with for the layer (used if viz_json is not present)
* created_at: not used
* modified_at: not used
